# Day 4 – S3 Versioning (Data Protection & Recovery)

Today focused on data protection and recovery using AWS S3 versioning.

## Key Concepts
- Versioning keeps multiple versions of the same object
- Protects against accidental deletion
- Protects against file overwrite
- Enables recovery of previous versions
- Foundation for backup and disaster recovery strategies

## Practical Task
Enabled versioning on the S3 bucket:
`datacenter-s3-27492`

## Why This Matters
In real systems, data loss is not a question of "if" but "when".
Versioning provides:
- recovery capability  
- audit trail  
- rollback support  
- data protection  
- operational safety  

## Learning Outcome
- Understood S3 versioning behavior
- Learned how AWS handles object history
- Understood data protection at storage level
- Hands-on experience with cloud data recovery mechanisms
