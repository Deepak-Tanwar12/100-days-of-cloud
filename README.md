# 100 Days of Cloud (AWS)

This repository documents my 100 Days of Cloud journey focused on AWS and DevOps.

Each day includes:
- notes.md (concepts learned)
- commands.txt (CLI/steps used)
- screenshots/ (console proof)

Goal: Build real-world cloud and DevOps skills through daily hands-on labs.

Consistency > motivation.
