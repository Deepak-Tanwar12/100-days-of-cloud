# Day 6 – EC2 Instance Creation (AWS Compute)

Today focused on launching and configuring an EC2 instance in AWS.

## Key Concepts
- EC2 provides scalable virtual compute in the cloud
- Instances are launched using AMIs (Amazon Machine Images)
- Instance types define CPU, memory, and performance
- Key pairs are used for secure SSH authentication
- Security groups act as virtual firewalls
- Instances run inside a VPC and subnet

## Practical Task
Created an EC2 instance with the following setup:
- Instance name: devops-ec2  
- AMI: Amazon Linux  
- Instance type: t2.micro  
- Key pair: devops-kp (RSA)  
- Security group: default  

## Why This Matters
Compute is the core of cloud infrastructure.
Everything from apps to APIs to databases runs on compute resources.

Understanding EC2 is foundational for:
- DevOps  
- Cloud engineering  
- System design  
- Infrastructure automation  

## Learning Outcome
- Understood EC2 architecture basics
- Learned AMI and instance type selection
- Learned secure access using key pairs
- Hands-on experience with AWS compute services
