# Day 8 – EC2 Stop Protection (Instance Safety)

Today focused on protecting critical EC2 resources by enabling stop protection.

## Key Concepts
- Stop protection prevents accidental stopping of EC2 instances
- Helps avoid unplanned downtime
- Commonly enabled on production or critical instances
- Acts as a safeguard against human error
- Part of operational and reliability best practices

## Practical Task
Enabled stop protection on an EC2 instance:
- Instance name: datacenter-ec2
- Region: us-east-1

## Why This Matters
In real-world environments, not all issues come from system failures.
Many outages happen due to accidental actions.

Stop protection helps:
- prevent accidental shutdowns
- protect critical workloads
- improve reliability
- enforce operational discipline

## Learning Outcome
- Learned how to enable stop protection
- Understood operational safety controls
- Gained hands-on experience with EC2 instance safeguards
- Improved understanding of production-level practices
