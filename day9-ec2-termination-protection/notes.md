# Day 9 – EC2 Termination Protection

Today focused on protecting critical infrastructure by enabling termination protection on an EC2 instance.

## Key Concepts
- Termination protection prevents accidental deletion of EC2 instances
- Useful for production or critical workloads
- Adds a safety layer against human error
- Can be enabled or disabled anytime

## Practical Task
Enabled termination protection on:
- Instance name: datacenter-ec2
- Region: us-east-1

## Why This Matters
In real cloud environments, accidental termination can:
- cause downtime
- result in data loss
- interrupt services

Simple safeguards like termination protection help maintain reliability and operational safety.

## Learning Outcome
- Learned how to enable termination protection
- Understood importance of infrastructure safety controls
- Gained hands-on experience with EC2 operational settings
